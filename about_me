The vision of Techerra has been born through an arduous journey through the engineering program at Memorial University of Newfoundland. 
This project is the evolution of an idea that was started in the operation of a small greenhouse in the community of Plaistow, NH. 
It was during this time when experiments in the possible synergies that could be made coupling process systems together had begun. 
Upon acquiring the technical skill sets necessary to complete such projects a new field of endeavor was opened with potential to improve the scope and impact of process system synergies. 
The creation of Techerra is a movement to establish a community that works together in the same synergistic way nature provides. 
Nature is a force of competition but also a network of cooperation and it is in this spirit that Techerra seeks to mold the future of technology and its interaction with earth and inhabitants.
