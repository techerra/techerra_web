Where are we?

The Current State......

The vision of Techerra evolves just as the web and the environment. 
The first goal is to keep the vision moving towards a more productive use of the energy invested into itself and the energy others invest in themselves. 
The documentation of the project is being built that can outline key positions of Techerra. 
This will serve as guideposts to provide direction and motivation ahead.

Currently website production is forming the basis of a communication tool. 
The main focus being existing projects and resources that are currently active and available that form a part of the Techerra vision in some way. 
The collection of varied resources is an attempt to leverage the vast array of scattered knowledge and form a cohesive body to drive community sustainability.

A community is the sum of its components and its value can be shared through the whole. 
As more resources are brought together on Techerra web it is hoped that value can be shared.
